## Prolouge
I don't really have an experience with reviewing literature, so I apologize in advance if I made this review unprofessional or wrong in some way.

The Constellation of Us is a manhua created by Longkun, originally published on Kuaikan Comics and translated in English by Tapas Media.

The story revolves Weiyu and Hao.

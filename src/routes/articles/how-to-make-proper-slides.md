# The Guide of making Slides Properly
When I was in elementary school, I was taught about making presentations using PowerPoint, I thought it was a skill that I would use rarely use but now I find it invaluable, especially when I find other people lacking on how to make clear, readable presentations.
So, I made this article to solve that, some few tricks to do so that everyone could actually see and read your presentation.
## General Presentation
### MAKE üëè IT üëè READABLE
 Make your slides **neat and readable**, this is the major rule in slide making.  Especially consider if the people in the back could read it. Here's some few ways to do that:

 1. **Use high contrast colors for your slides**
		Use dark colors for your background and light colors for your foreground, vice versa. **Nothing in between**
A great example for this is using a dark brown background and pearl white for text, icons, and logos. Just like this slide I made.

And not this:

This may seem fine up close, but if you step away for a bit, you'll see the difference. This slide also tackles about my second point towards readability and that is;
2. **Use highly readable fonts, like sans-serif and serif fonts.**
	Use fonts like Calibri, Times New Roman, Helvetica, and many others, stay away from what's called handwriting fonts or those cursive fonts, it may seem nice in a design standpoint but will be a accessibility nightmare for people since cursive fonts have lines which makes it harder to read in a distance.
3. **Increase your font size.**
One major problem I see often with poorly made slides is that their font size is too small for people to see. Increase your font size so that everyone could read it.
Extra Tip: **When in doubt, increase the font size as large as you can.**
If you don't know what's the proper font size to use, just increase it until everything breaks.
4. **Use as much slides as you can, there is no limit.**
Please, please, please, use as much slides as you can, never conserve your slides, if possible split sentences, stanzas, etc. Make it large and readable but not so split to the point no one cant really understand the visual aid.
## Images
### If your main subject is an image, make it take up at least 75% of the slide.
If your main content or main topic concerns an image for example, make it take up at least 75% of your whole content. This does not mean you should do it for images concerning the design of your work or images that are just there to compliment the main topic.
**For example**:

## Conclusion
That's all the things I know, I may update this soon, but who knows, so that's it for me, make your slides READABLE before you think about how beautiful it should be. My advice is consider about visually impaired people and people far from the presentation screen first, then the deisgn, people would thank you later.
